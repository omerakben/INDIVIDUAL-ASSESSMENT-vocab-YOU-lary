# üíª CODE ALONG

## Example Steps for App Completion when Working Alone

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started
- Create a Repo in GitHub from curriculum or template.
- Clone the repo locally.
- Complete all the items in the README for the template.
- Run `npm start` to make sure the boilerplate code loads on the DOM.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Persistent Data Storage
- Create a Firebase app (**COMPLETE ALL 7 REQUIRED STEPS**).
- Set up authentication:
  - Login/Signup
  - Sign out
- Deploy the application on **Netlify** and update the README with the deployment link.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Planning (Time Box This to No More Than 4 Hours)
1. Type out all the features the application needs in an instructions README and order them by priority.
2. Create issue tickets for **EVERY** feature, broken down into smaller parts.
3. Using the feature list, determine what data needs to be saved in the database.
4. Create an **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** based on the data needed and add it to the README.
5. Create wireframes based on the feature list and add them to the README.
6. Create mock data based on the ERD and place it in a `sample data` directory within the repo (tools like [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) can help).
7. Upload mock JSON data to Firebase.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Development
#### Process for Each Feature:
a. Start on features one-by-one.  
b. **Create a branch** for the feature.  
c. Code out the feature:
   - Ensure the container has all the data it needs.
   - Create helper functions/files for API calls as necessary.  
d. Build reusable components for elements requiring significant logic.
   - If logic is reusable, move it to a helper function/file.  
e. After every major change, **commit** with a descriptive message.  
f. Update the main README with the feature description and screenshots.  
g. Push the branch to GitHub once the feature is complete.  
h. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** and check the code to ensure you're pushing the correct updates.  
i. Merge the PR into the main branch.  
j. Verify the deployed app to ensure everything works as expected.  
k. Pull down the updated main branch.  

Repeat steps a-k for each feature.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Finishing Up
Ensure the README includes:
- **Name of the Project**
- **Overview of the Project**
- **Link to your wireframes/prototype**
- **Link to the deployed project**
- **Link to your project board** (even if it's part of the repo)
- **Description of the user**
- **List of features**
- **Screenshots of your project**
- **List of contributors** and links to their GitHub profiles
- **Link to Loom video walkthrough** of your app (keep it under 1 minute and make it engaging!)
